# README

****This**** repository contains a hybrid cipher designed to perform an xor calculation after transforming the 'key' and 'msg' variables 
into binary and decimal numbers. 

After a confusion and diffusion module is applied to make cryptanalysis difficult, the module is simple, it assigns a letter 
taken from a predetermined list to each decimal number.

> **enc-my-cipher.py:** This script performs the encryption, the goal was to create a script without libraries but note that it uses
the 'time' library so that it is possible to use the encryption function by double-clicking the file, we will have 5 seconds to copy the code exit.

> ****dec-my-cipher.py:**** This script performs the reverse process.
